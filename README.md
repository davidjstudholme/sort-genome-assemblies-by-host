Download bacterial genome assemblies and sort into folders according to BioProject 'host' field

## The problem I want to solve:
I wanted to mine for some patterns in *Staphylococcus aureus* genome sequences that associate with the host from which the bacteria were isolated.
The URLs for each genome assembly are available in this file: https://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/genbank/bacteria/Staphylococcus_aureus/assembly_summary.txt.
This file does not contain metadata such as host of isolation. However, this file does specify a BioSample for each Assembly and that metadata is held in the BioSample. We can download this metadata as an XML file from the NCBI's FTP site. Or we can download a simple flatfile from the NCBI's web interface.

So, the steps that this script performs are:
* Parse Assembly summary file
* Parse BioProject summary file
* Map Assemblies to BioProjects
* Infer host for each assembly
* Download each assembly into a directory whose name indicates the host

## Usage

```
git clone https://github.com/davidjstudholme/SortGenomeAssembliesByHost.git
python2 SortGenomeAssembliesByHost/parse_biosample_txt.py > assemblies-and-bioprojects.csv
```

The script expects to find two input files in the working directory: ```biosample_result.txt``` and ```assembly_summary.txt```.
The first of these can be generated using the "Send to file" function on the NCBI's BioProject we page. For example: at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/biosample/?term=Staphylococcus+aureus, click on "Send to file" and select "Text (full)" as the Format.  
The latter can be downloaded from the NCBI's FTP site, e.g. https://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/genbank/bacteria/Staphylococcus_aureus/assembly_summary.txt

As well as generating a tab-delimited table listing assemblies and some of their associated BioSample metadata, the script also uses wget to download the assembly data from NCBI:

It is necessary to gunzip the downloaded files, which are downloaded as .fna.gz and .gbff.gz files.
